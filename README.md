## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Mohtashem

I am a robotics engineer currently based in Milan. I am passionate about control systems, computer vision, automation and soft robotics development.
* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ROS based navigation in mobile robots
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ROS2 framework
* ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research projects involving robotic grasping control and/or soft robotic applications in locomotion and gripping.
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about control algorithms (force , null-space and adaptive-fuzzy), additive and subtractive manufacturing and Industrial Automation
* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with robotic application development, hard and soft-robot design, robot-deployment and commisioning.
